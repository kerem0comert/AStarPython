Once the submitted work is unzipped, the program will execute simply by running the following
command in the cmd:
python program.py

For all 12 node pairs, the program will denote the expanded nodes with "X".
Please note that, the X's do not represent the final path that the algorithm took, but rather
denotes all the points that were expanded. I decided to print it this way since in my opinion 
this would make the algorithm's actions more apparent rather than only outputing the final path.
